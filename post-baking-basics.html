  <h1>Baking Basics: Flour, Sugar, Leavening, and Temperature</h1>
  <p>Learning how ingredients behave is the fastest way to become confident in the kitchen.</p>

  <h2>Flour</h2>
  <p>All-purpose flour is most flexible. Bread flour has more protein (chewier). Cake flour is lower-protein (tender crumb). When measuring, spoon the flour into the cup and level it — don’t scoop directly.</p>

  <h2>Leavening</h2>
  <p>Baking powder and baking soda make things rise. Baking powder includes an acid; baking soda needs an acid to react. Use fresh leavening for best results (replace if older than ~6-12 months).</p>

  <h2>Temperature & Oven Tips</h2>
  <p>Oven thermostats can be off. Use an oven thermometer. For even browning, place pans in the center and avoid opening the door too often.</p>

  <h2>Sugar & Fats</h2>
  <p>Sugar tenderizes and browns; butter adds flavor and structure. When creaming butter and sugar, aim for light and airy for fluffy cakes.</p>

  <h2>Final advice</h2>
  <p>Start simple. Keep notes. Small changes yield big lessons — write down how a change affected the outcome.</p>
